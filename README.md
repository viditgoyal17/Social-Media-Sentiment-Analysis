# Social Media Sentiment Analyzer

A unified platform for real-time sentiment analysis of Instagram hashtags and Reddit subreddits, featuring both transformer-based and generative AI (GPT) models. The project includes interactive web interfaces for scraping, analysis, and result visualization.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Instagram Sentiment Analysis**
  - Scrapes hashtags, captions, and comments using Selenium.
  - Two implementations:  
    - **Transformer Model**: Classifies content as abusive/non-abusive.
    - **GenAI Model**: Provides detailed, descriptive sentiment using GPT (OpenAI).
  - Interactive web interface for real-time input and result display.

- **Reddit Sentiment Analysis**
  - Scrapes subreddit posts and comments using PRAW (Reddit API).
  - Uses generative AI (GPT) for sentiment summaries.
  - Web interface for subreddit input, mode selection, and result visualization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the desired implementation folder.**

2. **Install dependencies:**
*(Each implementation may have its own requirements. Common: Flask, openai, praw, selenium, transformers, etc.)*


3. **Set up API keys and credentials:**
   - **Instagram:**
     - Open `hashtag_scraper.py` in the relevant implementation folder (`GenAI Implementation` or `Transformer Implementation`).
     - Find the section where the script logs in (look for variables like `username` and `password`).
     - Replace the placeholder or dummy values with your Instagram account credentials.
     - Example:
       ```python
       username = "your_instagram_username"
       password = "your_instagram_password"
       ```
   - **Reddit:**
     - Open `reddit_scraper.py` in the `Reddit` folder.
     - Locate the section where the PRAW Reddit instance is created (look for `client_id`, `client_secret`, `user_agent`, etc.).
     - Replace the placeholders with your Reddit API credentials.
     - Example:
       ```python
       reddit = praw.Reddit(
           client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
           client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
           user_agent="YOUR_USER_AGENT"
       )
       ```
   - **OpenAI (GPT):**
     - Open `server.py` in the relevant implementation folder.
     - Find the line where the OpenAI API key is set (look for `openai.api_key` or similar).
     - Replace the placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key.
     - Example:
       ```python
       openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
       ```

4. **Run the backend server:**
    `python server.py`

5. **Open the frontend:**
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

- **Instagram:**  
- Go to the appropriate implementation folder (GenAI or Transformer).
- Enter a hashtag and select analysis mode (light/deep).
- View sentiment for each post and comment.

- **Reddit:**  
- Enter a subreddit name and select analysis mode (light/dark).
- View sentiment for each post and comment, plus overall post sentiment.

## üìÇ File Descriptions

- `hashtag_scraper.py` / `reddit_scraper.py`  
Scrapes Instagram hashtags or Reddit subreddits and saves content to JSON.

- `server.py`  
Flask backend for running scrapers, performing sentiment analysis, and serving the frontend.

- `index.html`, `script.js`  
Frontend files for user interaction and displaying results.

- `instagram_hashtag_posts.json` / `reddit_subreddit_posts.json`  
Intermediate data files storing scraped content.

---

## üìå Notes

- For Instagram scraping, a dummy account and Selenium WebDriver are required.
- For Reddit, you need to register a Reddit app for API credentials.
- OpenAI GPT-based analysis may incur API usage costs.
